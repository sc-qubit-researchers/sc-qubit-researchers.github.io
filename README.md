# sc-qubit-researchers.github.io
Website recording experimental researchers in the field of superconducting qubits

[Visit the map](https://sc-qubit-researchers.github.io)

Want to contribute? Check the map and/or the csv to determine that the lab or PI is not included, and then add an issue (auto generated through the website link). I will personally review these issues when I have time. 

To be eligible to be added to this list, I am only including experimental superconducting quantum computing (hardware) groups. Theoretical groups are much more abundant, and often not contrained to one qubit modality, especially in the case of computer science/software engineering labs. 

I was originally inspired by [this](https://quantumoptics.at/en/links/ion-trapping-worldwide.html) from the University of Innsbruck Dept. of Physics.
